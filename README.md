minibrew
========

I was feeling meh about homebrew, and I wanted to
have my own little package manager that downloaded, built
and installed packages from sources.

I'm not sure exactly everything that you need, but
you need `git` and enough *NIX tools installed to install
with `configure` and `make`.

On a macOS, having `Xcode` and command line tools installed
should be enough.


## Windows

On Windows, you will probably find it convenient to add `pkgs/bin` to your PATH.
You're expected to have `git` and `python` (Python3) installed in some manner.
You will need some version of `Visual Studio` installed (primarily to access
`msbuild`).
